This guy bought millions of dollars worth of ETH at 1$.  What a BOSS!
What a great interview - this really shows how crypto technology is starting to take off - this is an amazing time to be an investor.
Great interview! Please do more of these with notable crypto people to educate and spread the news of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!
Happy to see more sane investors coming into the crypto space ! This has happened in 2017 and I bet it will happen again. Until then I'll be fully stacked with ETH 2.0 and NFT,s and of course OGN, VeChain, ADA and so on !
One of the best interviews I’ve seen on the topic. Bravo
Mike is one of the most plugged-in cryto investors I've seen on Youtube: a real thrill to listen to him.
"The more I dig, the more exciting it gets"

I couldn't agree more. This is the future.
It's not only a currency it's a new way of how the new generation wants to live. Remember humans lead the way, not finance.
This is an amazing interview with Mike Novogratz...... Thank you Bloomberg!  #Bitcoin #LiteCoin & #Ethereum is the future!
Jaw dropped when he said he got ether when it was a dollar a coin
Very good interview, balanced and covering many issues not covered elsewhere.
This guy made a right move.
I hold so much respect for how he explained his role  and responsibilities... great visionary
Hooray for Mr. Novogratz for standing your ground and having a thorough explanation of positiveness in the Bitcoin space and other crypto currencies.
I love how sharp and sparkling his eyes are. What an inspiring person Mike is.
Mike is such an awesome and smart man, but the world constantly misinterprets his 'claims', I like him. He also makes mistakes, he also admits those mistakes, but people that claim the guy is nuts or wrong will never be as rich as him mark my words ;-)
'Bitcoin is the revenge of the nerds' - love it.
I learned more about crypto from this guy than I could from 100 nerds. He boiled it down just perfectly for me, and gave me an even greater sense of confidence in my investments going forward. What a smart man he is.
This was a phenomenal interview! Thanks!
Great interview, Mike Novogratz is an immensely smart guy
This was a great interview.  I know many of the people he spoke of.  Working in the securities industry for 30 years I see the switch going on.  Believe me this industry will be bigger than the late nineties internet and e commerce beginnings.  Once the adoption of this technology goes main stream it wont stop.  Like he said it is will be a cultural revolution.
That was amazing. The interviewer was one of the best I've seen as well. Awesome content. Thank you for that!
Smart man. Great job Bloomberg!
This interview still rings true today, nothing has changed in this space, Bitcoin reached 20k soon after this interview, now it is roughly 10k, still a wonderful opportunity now to stack some Satoshi's , exciting times ahead.
"One of the advantages of being a macro guy is that you inderstand the psychology of bubbles and you how to ride the horse" 

At least he's honest about it. Cryptos are a massive speculative bubble and the people who know how to "ride the horse" are going to benefit, all the other suckers will end up licking their wounds..
I disagree that crypto can't be currency because its unstable. If more people buy into crypto the price will stabilize. I plan on buying with crypto when it is more widely accepted but I will still hold in reserve some BTC and LTC and Eth....always.
By the time most people want to learn about the specifics of crypto, programmers will make it easier to understand.
Well this has definitely aged well!
Amazing interview, really like this guy
Wow what a great interview, very informative, thanks Bloomberg. Novogratz seems one interesting dude actually.
Good for him seriously!!! God bless him for seeing the vision
SO POWERFULL AND SO GOOD FOR THE EDUCATION SIDE THANKS SIR MIKE N.
Yes! He saw the light! He's in!
Bitcoin is more than an investment, it's a social advancement.
This is the first- only!- interview of a serious mainstream trader who actually understands the technology and is not being badgered and manipulated with fake news FUDD faux questions. It's not quite perfect. His bubble/volatility and currency comments are not quite right. Bitcoin is, like gold, deflationary money. Not mere currency, good only for transactions, but REAL MONEY good for BOTH transactions AND SAVINGS. But this is far better than anything this side of an Andreas Antonopoulos video. I am quite frankly stunned that Bloomberg allowed such a thoughtful and well-informed interview to ever see the light of day. Pass it on people before they take it down.
Excellent! So much institutional money is coming into this space. With the rates of inflation, the US dollar isn't stable either. It's imploding like all fiat. This 24/7 decentralized blockchain market has zero boundaries, zero borders and obsolete plutocratic governments have no authority over any of it nor do they have any right to. Parasitic governments need to shut up and mind their own business. 

Banks will go the way of blockbuster video! Why do we need them to keep our money, while they make a fortune off it and give us nothing for it? Less than 1% a yr interest is pathetic and we're done with them and their Ponzi. If we took all our money out of the banks they would collapse and rightly so.
Legend. Still crushing it in 2021 and hopefully for the next decade.
Sounds like he already knew that they would make it bubble, he also called the futures coming which is what pretty much made the crash. 

Still crypto will be bigger then it has been.
thanks for uploading this interview Bloomberg
We want more videos on documenting people who have invested in cryptocurrency.
at the time of the interview one BTC was @4000 USD/ea. What a steal! This guy is genious, he realised how to make, not millions with it, but BILLIONS! Wise guy rly.
Awesome discussion....love it and have invested a small amount of money myself into a handful of coins. Want to share crypto with my children.
Awesome perspective... this is maybe the reason why he is such a successful investor.
Fantastic interview :)
Once fiat is converted to digital, there's little the governments can do to regulate it. They're biggest stranglehold can be the on and off ramps of fiat to digital and back. Just like the marijuana industry, the government can control when you try and get your fiat into the banking system.
Great interview and  many great new ideas. Thank you and BRAVO to Mike Novogratz . Many bright people believe that a Crypto currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, will become the New Global Reserve Currency in the next few years, replacing the DOLLAR! They also believe that the phenomenal rise in price of ONE Bitcoin (from 7 cents to $5,000, in 9 years, 2009 to 2017 !) really represents the FALL of the Dollar system. Remember that it is NOT The Bitcoin that is rising so fast, but in fact, we are witnessing, in Real Time, the tremendous FALLING VALUE of the DOLLAR worldwide!  The fall of the DOLLAR is caused by the US System endlessly printing Trillions and Trillions Dollars, all the time, therefore we will soon experience a Venezuelan type Super Hyper Inflation. Because that is exactly what the banks did in Venezuela! We all need to wake up.
One of the best pieces I've seen for this space. thanks.
Mike is incredible!
20:15 Currencies are stable because they use Exchange Stabilization Funds and QE to manipulate the market price. Bitcoin will get more stable as its adopted but it will represent true market value unlike fiat debt notes.
Great interview!
5:00 This is the problem in money. The institutions that are trustworthy often trade places or are bought by the ones that aren't.
The DAO was not a hack. It was an exploit.There's a fundamental difference.
Terribly smug, uninformed and biased interviewer. Wonderfully informed, genuine and balanced guest.
The tv host ran right after the show to open an account in Coinbase :D
He says "Bitcoin WAS an amazing revolution in Economics - can you create a currency with a Fixed Supply" - does he realize that Experiment has never been done? No one runs a Decentralized Currency with a Fixed Supply - otherwise no one would provide sufficient computing power to keep it Decentralized.  Blockchains are run on computers, and the value is that they are run on THOUSANDS of Computers so spread out and uncontrollable, unhackable, etc that you can't take down the network, and the processing of transactions is Decentralized to where that processing can't be controlled.  Only PIVX is built to be permanently robust computing network that is totally owner run - which was Satoshi's goal, though he failed to foresee the centralization of mining power, and the lack of Global Node Distribution that failing to incentivize nodes has created.
Clever man....A very clever man indeed!!!
Fantastic video. Thank you publishing!
I want to meet this guy, he is incredibly smart.
this guy is awesome.
Bitcoin won't stabilize until the supply runs it's course, or comes close to it, and the infrastructure for transactions has spread itself out enough for people to use it as a currency.
I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF...I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET... CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO?
21:09
He said what everybody is saying without realizing what it means:
"When I think of Bitcoin, I think of digital gold; it's a store of value." That's the song of the dead. It's not gold, it's not even not even 10 years old! It has the 1st to market advantage for right now, but it's a vastly inferior product. (too slow and way too expensive to transfer.) It's 1st to market advantage is only going to last for a short time longer and better products, like Litecoin, is going to start to steal market-share.
Cryptocurrency value is in it's actual or anticipated utility, which Bitcoin doesn't have much of anymore. Its days are numbered.
Sounds like he's Pining for the same ol BS that this movement is making obsolete. Other than that, great interview. Salute
Great interview
"What on earth got you interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?" - hahaha, reminds me of that question on a comedy chatshow many years ago, "So what was it that drew you to multi-millionaire Paul Daniels?"
Crypto's are EASY to trade because Algo's have not fucked with it so heavily as they have the stock market. It's still human driven. THAT'S why it attracts so many traders.
finally, someone who can explain it to the average joes who still won't get it.
Sailing around Greece for 21 days you would see these abandoned homes, on premium properties. Asking the Captain why weren’t they developed, it came down to title insecurity. You could buy it, build it, then someone could claim it. Add the blockchain into title, and watch the investments come. Announce a two year period to make all claims, the auction off the properties.,Greece’s debt problem, no problem.
Wallstreet would definitely have troubles understanding what crypto is and what it can do. I think only a macro guy like Novogratz gets it, regardless of his technical understanding.
Even if he has held on to 60% of that original ETH purchase, he is north of a billion today on that one investment.  Not too shabby.
Thanks bloomberg!
Mike Novogratz is now heavily invested in EOS through a joint venture. EOS will take crypto to mass adoption. Going to be huge.
21:54 "How high?" 

M2 Dollars $18,318,200,000,000 ÷ World Gold 6,352,216,000oz = $2,884/oz

M2 Dollars $18,318,200,000,000 ÷ Bitcoin 21,000,000 = $872,295/BTC

1BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis ÷ $872,295.00c = 1.14 Satoshi per cent

Ultimate price will be dependent on how many dollars (or local currency) exist.
This interview aged well ...
21:40 "There are very few of them" While there are only 21m Bitcoins each one represent 100,000,000 Satoshis. It's really 2.1 quadrillion satoshi coins!
Man only 1 month later and Bitcoin passes $7500
Wow. One of the best interviews in the space!
Hard not to like this guy. His perspective certainly resonates. The animal spirit piece - absolutely.
Dude's a beast
Perhaps this man will eventually stop following the amoral way of life. It is good he probably sees what the underlying aim of Bitcoin is: not decentralisation of itself, but the people reclaiming their individual birthright of sovereignty.
As long as he stays stuck in his traditional thinking and acting, I'd rather he'd stay with the assets that have less actual value..
Great video.
It's not just money, it's the tech behind it that your buying into.
Novogratz talking about wednesday night mixers at the 4:00 mark reminded me of a scene from a Dylan song:  "there was music in the cafes at night, revolution in the air."
Thanks for this.
31:50 China shut down the exchanges but people still exchange peer to peer. LocalBitcoins 1BTC = 73,000.00 CNY (8-Oct-2020). Bitcoin doesn't need any central authority to work its borderless and permissionless. By banning it you just lose the opportunity tax and regulate it.
He's right except for none being currency. Tether is. But yeah BTC is definitely digital gold.
Uber can be replaced by a blockchain tech with de centralized ownership with the taxi drivers if anyone creates it i think it would be a good idea.
JPM's Diamon said he will fire anyone trading BitCoin while he was buying it for his clients. Whom will BitCoin hurt the most? Bankers. Who's the biggest of them all? JPM. Go Mike!
Super valuable hindsight
you need to learn the fundamentals and keep educating yourself from there. Not everyone understands how credit cards work, yet we all use them. Its good to know some behind the scenes and with crypto you will need to know more than what was required in the past but you can still use and invest in the currency.
Good interview
this Novo guy is a sharp dude
Erik Schatzker is top notch!  He knows a lot about the topic, unlike that nitwit, Tucker Carlson at Fox!  Great questions and he allows his guest to finish sentences!  I hate it when they bring on a guest that I really want to hear and before he can finish any sentence, they pounce on him with another question or a stupid comment that adds no value!  Good job, Erik!  Thumbs up!
7:44 " And I paid my tax... cause Im good paying tax citizen" lol
Check Coingeek: But despite Craig being the real-world figure behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym credited with inventing Bitcoin back in 2008, Craig is not part of the Association, a decision that was intended from day one to demonstrate that no single individual controls BSV.
HE GETS IT
This is necessary!  This guy is correct and has the track record to prove it.  I have a model called 500/100 where £500 can in 100 days of compounding your returns earned by a bot a firm passive income can be created.  The eighth wonder meets the crypto-verse!  Do you have 100 working days to get a cut of the kind of funding he is talking about.  A massive growth in BTC price has been predicted by the fourth quarter.  100 days to go!   Transform your life!
BITCOIN is not like a stock or like gold or silver or ANYTHING , it is unique and limited in quantity and for that reason it has tremendous value , I call it a game changer .

It has the potential to change the WORLD for the better  FACT ,   reduce world poverty FACT and for that  reason I fully support it.
I love how the interviewer looks like he want's to fuck the other dudes money for the entire interview.
Don't give up on BTC. I believe in crypto,The last 2 months, I have made over $60,000 from trading bitcoin but my success never started that way as I had made substantial losses before my turning point in the Crypto space. I said I would never deal with bitcoin because of so much loss.Bitcoin is going  to win again. So I want to purchase some more Bitcoin in advance. Bitcoin would always be around because of the coin exchange and it's blockchain. I would bet on the side that always wins. That is a pretty safe bet,  although I was able to make $32,000 in the space of 1 month with the help of Dickey Fred who is a Pro Trader and has been helping Novice crypto investors showing them ways to trade their Bitcoin. he is down to earth and always ready to serve, tho He charged me after  I made profits, but it was worth it. I just want to spread the word and thereby help anyone that are in my previous unfortunate situation. For all questions, you can reach out for his help on his  HANGOUTS/Mail (dickeyfred562@gmail. com)
THIS GUY SHOULD BE KING OF THE WORLD HE IS SO SMART!!!!! BITCOIN IS GONNA BE WORLD MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE SOON AND IDIOTS DONT GET IT!!!!
Square card reader is 3.25%+$.15 to use.  $3.60 per $100.00. $103.60 to send/ $96.4 to receive $100.  3.25% is not hard for crypto to compete with.
Laughs as they disparage D&D .. but it's making a HUGE comeback too.
See the evolution from ruthless opportunistic trader to revolutionary technologist.  The world, like the interviewer, is not yet prepared.
Digibyte will skyrocket the market! Digibyte has solved every flaw old cryptos had! Mark my words! Here we are, and the time is near.
bitcoin to the moon
Just finished this. Respect to Novogratz. The interviewer needs to be fired asap. For Gods Sake!
I have a riddle for Novogratz - (1) what's the "stability" of a Debt Based Currency when the Debt Bubble Pops? (2) What's the "stablility" of a $100 Bill on Fire?  You're a Macro guy? Seriously? Your perspective is myopic to your lifetime - you aren't as smart as you think you are. We're watching a Debt Supercycle run its course, and the "Macro" perspective needs to be a lot longer than your lifetime or mine.
There is a big difference between money and currency. Understand it and know which is a store of value, and which is not. Use your #commonsense or accept the consecuences.
LOL . . . It is still early days, but one thing is certain.  The government and financial institutions are already on red alert regarding all crypto currencies.  If anybody think they are going to give up their power to control society,  along with the power to milk them for profits,  they are in for a surprise.  Everyone seem to think they are untouchable in this "online virtual world",  but they forget that government has control over,  or can gain power over the signal you require to be online. Once the threat becomes to strong and they lose too much money,  they will simply cut you off from utilizing the network.  Already everyone that is on the Apple platform can be switched off by flicking a switch.  You cant use your iPhone if they don't switch it on. . . .and you cant do nothing if they decide to switch it off . . . .all the millions In crypto currencies will be useless to you if you cant access it. . . . like I said, early days. . . I no the crypto enthusiast will remain optimistic,  but lets also be realistic . . . .we all know what's going on behind the scenes where the power struggles for world domination is taking place . . . .Money is power so they will put up a fight to retain it. . . just saying, but all the best.
If this guy has strong hands he would have made 2.0 billion USD from 2.0 milion at the moment of writing this.
From that I gathered it NOT a currency, its a technology. It is a bubble which will pop, some will crypto-currencies will crash to nothing, BUT the technology which seems to be his main focus, is here to stay and will be developed.
Mike mentions Gemini which is a great exchange, however there's Coinbase too,  this is the other one that has been around a very long time. They too are regulated. Coinbase info.  https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2689172-is-coinbase-regulated-
Feburary 20th 2021 today and bitcoin hit $57,000 and eth is $1,879
Wonder what percentage of his portfolio is cryptocurrency now!
"theres going to be a blockchain for wine"

enter, VeChain
The revolution is in trust & decentralisation.
bitcoin is like "dungeons and dragons on steroids."
There's going to be some serious altcoin fatique in the nex 10 years . MOST will die and the value comes BACK to bitcoin .
Even This guy is underestimating who all is getting involved with crypto. I’m from Graham and Doddsville.
this guy bought $2m of ethereum @$1 each - it just crossed $600 each - casual $1.2b profit
AWesome! welcome to my world Beeotches!!
yes! needs more views!
13:20 "...it's not a money thing..." -- but the billions must help?
I have a feeling a lot of the viewers here where in diapers during the .com bubble.. while it has recovered “some”.  do you know anybody that stayed on board after the margin calls?  Just take Mark Cuban for example.. he made a fortune selling his polished turd tech that I believe became obsolete a short time later..
"Decentralized world" Dare I say....decentraland.
Everyone should be watching this video now that its 2021.
The market is young,  that's why so much volatility.   People are coming in.  I am in all the way for the long run.
Bloomberg guy is like our parents
Joe Lubin has got some genius going on. Link ahead on with him outlining how #Ethereum and #Blockchain are enabling actual revolutionary systems to suffer less from 'extended clearing and settlement' https://youtu.be/hThZ8mruqTw
If you want to understand what is going on here better. Begin with the blockchain. It basically makes use of two fields, with decades of research: asymmetric cryptography  & distributed ledger systems. Its power comes in the problems it solves and the opportunities it creates. For the hundreds of millions of people globally who are locked out banking at Chase. For anyone with any records to keep or making business transactions doing away with the need for trust third parties. Anyone living in a country where the gov't is running the money into the ground. etc etc etc. This is going to change so many things in so many ways. It's just going to take, like he says, 10 years or whatever. Spend some time checking out some of these projects,, theyre all over the place. what a time. ;)!!
I want life to be tokenized
Great interview, a great insight into the world of cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin in is digital gold, owning it will change the level of your future wealth entirely.   Accumulate as much Bitcoin as you can, as quick as you can.  The day will come that you wont need to sell it and convert it back into fiat money, you will be able to use bitcoin to purchase all your goods and services.  Bitcoin is already widely accepted,

"[...] all the smug arrogance that comes along with this world [...]" - lmao
he is right. you can't keep even a 100k under kitchen sink..maybe thats where the banks will step in
Very smart personality
And now 28/11almost 10.000 dollars! Insane
At 16:53 they start talking about Dungeons and Dragons. Literally.
Implementation!!!
Bail Project chief funder Michael Novogratz is pure evil bailing out arrested “Felons” who go back and commit crimes again including murder. This guy should be put in jail.
i love tis guy!
Most people at Bloomberg have been bribed already
and the price went sky high from there....
It is worth drawing attention to Japan.

Somebodys gain is someone else' loss. If this guy ""won"" hundred of millions, means many people must have lost that money. Its more like a lottery, many pay in and a few make a killing. Good luck folks.
so wallstreet wants to enter the cryptospace? then i shoud HODL more and make them pay for it 100X, i suggest the same to all cryptohodlers out there
Great! Investing on bitcoin is really risky but itll give you a lot of money..but lets not forget other uprising coins like the LEDU COIN which i heard has a burning of token in July. What do you think about this? time to buy?
I like this dude
ETN to the Moon! :)
 bitcoin is going down and fast
Great Interview! Subbed. I am researching this topic to prepare for the trading of bitcoin on CME. Will make videos about this in the future.
anti-government?  what evidence is there that there is a government?
Far more "smug arrogance" in this interviewer and in traditional finance than in crypto.
its just a previously super rich guy, who got on the bitcoin train, and became even more rich... um... wouldnt we all be if we had 2 million to throw around here and there
If Bitcoin pops at some point will litecoin and Ethereum and other altcoins most likely shoot up off of it?
These folks arent anything special they just had large amounts of money to invest at the start. meanwhile us peasants maybe not of made millions but we made thousands.
wait... floyd mayweather knows how to use a computer? he bought bitcoin? when did he learn how to read?
Ether is $736 12/13/17
Gotta love that pesky fly. LOL
2:49 there a fly flying around. I can't unsee and now you also can't.
Who the hell does Eric Schatzker think he is, laughing at the “smug arrogance” of the crypto community at 15:20, and then to absolutely epitomizing the smug arrogance of Wall Street at 16:55-17:08?  Look at that smirk when he says "dungeons and dragons on steroids!"  We'll see who has the last laugh, Mr. Tom Ford Suit...
Bitcoin is going to bankrupt our government and I can't wait to see it happen.  I'm going to hire former US senators and congressmen to clean my toilets.  Litecoin and Monero will help in the destruction of the evil empire and bring these false flag luciferians to their knees. Let us never forget 911 and US and Israel being behind it!
"not in jesuscoin" lmao
The only bubble that is going to burst is FIAT currency , it's printed paper worthless , BITCOIN on the other hand has actual value it costs over 1000 US dollars to make one BITCOIN , so it has REAL value . WAKE THE $%^& UP .
If something is booming all these guys come out of the woodworks....
100 usd for 5 months will make the average person rich
One year later 9/1/2018 the same but BETTER excitement is with a MUCH BETTER technology and that is CLOUDCOIN and the RAIDA Technology that fixes all of Bitcoin and Ethereum's problems!  Cloudcoin will be that digital currency (not cryptocurrency) that becomes the worlds RETAIL currency for many-many reasons -- that Bitcoin could never be.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ItxBDPkRBw

GO.... BITCOIN .... GO .
OUR GUY
he convinced a lot o people to buy cripto with this video. How many did lose money, because they thought this guy says good things?
The bloomberg guy is clueless. He won't understand until it's too late.
Cryptos will disintegrate the world.
I really got reengaged. I realized I could make a FAK ton of money.
Bitcoin has the BRAND NAME to overcome ALL the negatives. It is the FERRARI of crypto currencies , NEVER FORGET THAT .  That's is exactly why it will keep on going up in price. I fully expect BTC to pass the 100k by this time next year and reach a million in 3 to 5 years.
 
Do not be left behind join the RESISTANCE , even micro bits of BITCOIN will serve you well in the future . As always ONLY invest in what you can afford to lose , even the MIGHTY BITCOIN has some risk , small but some , I say GO....BITCOIN.....GO .
Right now it appears that the Big crytpo "whales" the owners of the most cryptos are using the following schemes to make the price volatile: 1 Pump and Dump 2: Market Makers posting Hype news 3: Complex and fast trading Algorithms buying cryto then selling quickly within minutes to seconds to capture quick profits 4: WASH TRADING 5: SPOOFING....... the small crypto investor has little chance - good luck.
That damn fly in the video! Dude needs a shower! LOL!
Here you have probably the next bitconnect with great returns, ICO starts in November, dont miss out and sign up now: https://ethconnect.net/ref/veroner

Does he still fly helicopters ?
Funny no one mentioned there's a fly near his head at 2:51
buy bitcoin!
does anyone else notice that damned fly hovering around mike's mouth?
Bitcoin is inferior to Litecoin. It's "1st to market" advantage is going to start to get eaten away sometimes soon.
You can hear people saying it, "Ya, it's not very functional, but it's a store of value". Really, a store of value in something that isn't very functional. That's not going to last long.
that fly tho
This guy was honest: bitcoin is a bubble and it is the largest bubble of our life time and at one point sell before it goes to zero and it is a dangerous space.  In all Ponzi schemes there is money to be made and bitcoin is the mother load. Got your bitcoin?
ICO = LENDING SCAM,  BITCOIN is KING.  Don't use shit but BITCOIN / LITECOIN.  Even he said it "MONEY LOSER" his ICO = PRODUCT TO SCREW YOU.

This guy admittedly doesn't really understand the technology very well. Decentralized identity is not looking very hopeful, and the example of a "blockchain for wine" (whatever the fuck that means) will also never happen. Bitcoin is the big innovation. Soon all these investor noobs will figure out the tech, and how much is over-invested in alt-coins and icos. Buy Bitcoin.
nice, but anyone else noticed the annoying fly in front of the camera lmao?
Buy BCH = the real Bitcoin. P2P electronic cash. As it was stated in the original whitepaper. Disregard clowns like Roger Ver. BCH has solved and stuck to Satoshis original vision. Ask yourself why Gavin Andresen is with BCH now. The answer is BTC is backed by cooperates, banks and bilderberg.

This guy bought millions of dollars worth of ETH at 1$.  What a BOSS!


What a great interview - this really shows how crypto technology is starting to take off - this is an amazing time to be an investor.


Great interview! Please do more of these with notable crypto people to educate and spread the news of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!


Happy to see more sane investors coming into the crypto space ! This has happened in 2017 and I bet it will happen again. Until then I'll be fully stacked with ETH 2.0 and NFT,s and of course OGN, VeChain, ADA and so on !


One of the best interviews I’ve seen on the topic. Bravo


Mike is one of the most plugged-in cryto investors I've seen on Youtube: a real thrill to listen to him.


"The more I dig, the more exciting it gets"

I couldn't agree more. This is the future.


It's not only a currency it's a new way of how the new generation wants to live. Remember humans lead the way, not finance.


This is an amazing interview with Mike Novogratz...... Thank you Bloomberg!  #Bitcoin #LiteCoin & #Ethereum is the future!


Jaw dropped when he said he got ether when it was a dollar a coin


Very good interview, balanced and covering many issues not covered elsewhere.


This guy made a right move.


I hold so much respect for how he explained his role  and responsibilities... great visionary


Hooray for Mr. Novogratz for standing your ground and having a thorough explanation of positiveness in the Bitcoin space and other crypto currencies.


I love how sharp and sparkling his eyes are. What an inspiring person Mike is.


Mike is such an awesome and smart man, but the world constantly misinterprets his 'claims', I like him. He also makes mistakes, he also admits those mistakes, but people that claim the guy is nuts or wrong will never be as rich as him mark my words ;-)


'Bitcoin is the revenge of the nerds' - love it.


I learned more about crypto from this guy than I could from 100 nerds. He boiled it down just perfectly for me, and gave me an even greater sense of confidence in my investments going forward. What a smart man he is.


This was a phenomenal interview! Thanks!


Great interview, Mike Novogratz is an immensely smart guy


This was a great interview.  I know many of the people he spoke of.  Working in the securities industry for 30 years I see the switch going on.  Believe me this industry will be bigger than the late nineties internet and e commerce beginnings.  Once the adoption of this technology goes main stream it wont stop.  Like he said it is will be a cultural revolution.


That was amazing. The interviewer was one of the best I've seen as well. Awesome content. Thank you for that!


Smart man. Great job Bloomberg!


This interview still rings true today, nothing has changed in this space, Bitcoin reached 20k soon after this interview, now it is roughly 10k, still a wonderful opportunity now to stack some Satoshi's , exciting times ahead.


"One of the advantages of being a macro guy is that you inderstand the psychology of bubbles and you how to ride the horse" 

At least he's honest about it. Cryptos are a massive speculative bubble and the people who know how to "ride the horse" are going to benefit, all the other suckers will end up licking their wounds..


I disagree that crypto can't be currency because its unstable. If more people buy into crypto the price will stabilize. I plan on buying with crypto when it is more widely accepted but I will still hold in reserve some BTC and LTC and Eth....always.


By the time most people want to learn about the specifics of crypto, programmers will make it easier to understand.


Well this has definitely aged well!


Amazing interview, really like this guy


Wow what a great interview, very informative, thanks Bloomberg. Novogratz seems one interesting dude actually.


Good for him seriously!!! God bless him for seeing the vision


SO POWERFULL AND SO GOOD FOR THE EDUCATION SIDE THANKS SIR MIKE N.


Yes! He saw the light! He's in!
Bitcoin is more than an investment, it's a social advancement.


Legend. Still crushing it in 2021 and hopefully for the next decade.


thanks for uploading this interview Bloomberg


Sounds like he already knew that they would make it bubble, he also called the futures coming which is what pretty much made the crash. 

Still crypto will be bigger then it has been.


We want more videos on documenting people who have invested in cryptocurrency.


at the time of the interview one BTC was @4000 USD/ea. What a steal! This guy is genious, he realised how to make, not millions with it, but BILLIONS! Wise guy rly.


Awesome discussion....love it and have invested a small amount of money myself into a handful of coins. Want to share crypto with my children.


Fantastic interview :)


Awesome perspective... this is maybe the reason why he is such a successful investor.


One of the best pieces I've seen for this space. thanks.


Mike is incredible!


20:15 Currencies are stable because they use Exchange Stabilization Funds and QE to manipulate the market price. Bitcoin will get more stable as its adopted but it will represent true market value unlike fiat debt notes.


Great interview!


5:00 This is the problem in money. The institutions that are trustworthy often trade places or are bought by the ones that aren't.


The DAO was not a hack. It was an exploit.There's a fundamental difference.


The tv host ran right after the show to open an account in Coinbase :D


Terribly smug, uninformed and biased interviewer. Wonderfully informed, genuine and balanced guest.


Clever man....A very clever man indeed!!!


He says "Bitcoin WAS an amazing revolution in Economics - can you create a currency with a Fixed Supply" - does he realize that Experiment has never been done? No one runs a Decentralized Currency with a Fixed Supply - otherwise no one would provide sufficient computing power to keep it Decentralized.  Blockchains are run on computers, and the value is that they are run on THOUSANDS of Computers so spread out and uncontrollable, unhackable, etc that you can't take down the network, and the processing of transactions is Decentralized to where that processing can't be controlled.  Only PIVX is built to be permanently robust computing network that is totally owner run - which was Satoshi's goal, though he failed to foresee the centralization of mining power, and the lack of Global Node Distribution that failing to incentivize nodes has created.


Fantastic video. Thank you publishing!


this guy is awesome.


I want to meet this guy, he is incredibly smart.


I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF...I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET... CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO?


Bitcoin won't stabilize until the supply runs it's course, or comes close to it, and the infrastructure for transactions has spread itself out enough for people to use it as a currency.


21:09
He said what everybody is saying without realizing what it means:
"When I think of Bitcoin, I think of digital gold; it's a store of value." That's the song of the dead. It's not gold, it's not even not even 10 years old! It has the 1st to market advantage for right now, but it's a vastly inferior product. (too slow and way too expensive to transfer.) It's 1st to market advantage is only going to last for a short time longer and better products, like Litecoin, is going to start to steal market-share.
Cryptocurrency value is in it's actual or anticipated utility, which Bitcoin doesn't have much of anymore. Its days are numbered.


Great interview


Sounds like he's Pining for the same ol BS that this movement is making obsolete. Other than that, great interview. Salute


"What on earth got you interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?" - hahaha, reminds me of that question on a comedy chatshow many years ago, "So what was it that drew you to multi-millionaire Paul Daniels?"


finally, someone who can explain it to the average joes who still won't get it.


Sailing around Greece for 21 days you would see these abandoned homes, on premium properties. Asking the Captain why weren’t they developed, it came down to title insecurity. You could buy it, build it, then someone could claim it. Add the blockchain into title, and watch the investments come. Announce a two year period to make all claims, the auction off the properties.,Greece’s debt problem, no problem.


Crypto's are EASY to trade because Algo's have not fucked with it so heavily as they have the stock market. It's still human driven. THAT'S why it attracts so many traders.


Wallstreet would definitely have troubles understanding what crypto is and what it can do. I think only a macro guy like Novogratz gets it, regardless of his technical understanding.


Thanks bloomberg!


Even if he has held on to 60% of that original ETH purchase, he is north of a billion today on that one investment.  Not too shabby.


Mike Novogratz is now heavily invested in EOS through a joint venture. EOS will take crypto to mass adoption. Going to be huge.


This interview aged well ...


21:54 "How high?" 

M2 Dollars $18,318,200,000,000 ÷ World Gold 6,352,216,000oz = $2,884/oz

M2 Dollars $18,318,200,000,000 ÷ Bitcoin 21,000,000 = $872,295/BTC

1BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis ÷ $872,295.00c = 1.14 Satoshi per cent

Ultimate price will be dependent on how many dollars (or local currency) exist.


Man only 1 month later and Bitcoin passes $7500


21:40 "There are very few of them" While there are only 21m Bitcoins each one represent 100,000,000 Satoshis. It's really 2.1 quadrillion satoshi coins!


Wow. One of the best interviews in the space!


Dude's a beast


Hard not to like this guy. His perspective certainly resonates. The animal spirit piece - absolutely.


Great video.


Perhaps this man will eventually stop following the amoral way of life. It is good he probably sees what the underlying aim of Bitcoin is: not decentralisation of itself, but the people reclaiming their individual birthright of sovereignty.
As long as he stays stuck in his traditional thinking and acting, I'd rather he'd stay with the assets that have less actual value..


It's not just money, it's the tech behind it that your buying into.


Thanks for this.


Novogratz talking about wednesday night mixers at the 4:00 mark reminded me of a scene from a Dylan song:  "there was music in the cafes at night, revolution in the air."


He's right except for none being currency. Tether is. But yeah BTC is definitely digital gold.


31:50 China shut down the exchanges but people still exchange peer to peer. LocalBitcoins 1BTC = 73,000.00 CNY (8-Oct-2020). Bitcoin doesn't need any central authority to work its borderless and permissionless. By banning it you just lose the opportunity tax and regulate it.


Uber can be replaced by a blockchain tech with de centralized ownership with the taxi drivers if anyone creates it i think it would be a good idea.


Super valuable hindsight


JPM's Diamon said he will fire anyone trading BitCoin while he was buying it for his clients. Whom will BitCoin hurt the most? Bankers. Who's the biggest of them all? JPM. Go Mike!


Good interview


you need to learn the fundamentals and keep educating yourself from there. Not everyone understands how credit cards work, yet we all use them. Its good to know some behind the scenes and with crypto you will need to know more than what was required in the past but you can still use and invest in the currency.


this Novo guy is a sharp dude


7:44 " And I paid my tax... cause Im good paying tax citizen" lol


Erik Schatzker is top notch!  He knows a lot about the topic, unlike that nitwit, Tucker Carlson at Fox!  Great questions and he allows his guest to finish sentences!  I hate it when they bring on a guest that I really want to hear and before he can finish any sentence, they pounce on him with another question or a stupid comment that adds no value!  Good job, Erik!  Thumbs up!


HE GETS IT


Check Coingeek: But despite Craig being the real-world figure behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym credited with inventing Bitcoin back in 2008, Craig is not part of the Association, a decision that was intended from day one to demonstrate that no single individual controls BSV.


This is necessary!  This guy is correct and has the track record to prove it.  I have a model called 500/100 where £500 can in 100 days of compounding your returns earned by a bot a firm passive income can be created.  The eighth wonder meets the crypto-verse!  Do you have 100 working days to get a cut of the kind of funding he is talking about.  A massive growth in BTC price has been predicted by the fourth quarter.  100 days to go!   Transform your life!


THIS GUY SHOULD BE KING OF THE WORLD HE IS SO SMART!!!!! BITCOIN IS GONNA BE WORLD MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE SOON AND IDIOTS DONT GET IT!!!!


BITCOIN is not like a stock or like gold or silver or ANYTHING , it is unique and limited in quantity and for that reason it has tremendous value , I call it a game changer .

It has the potential to change the WORLD for the better  FACT ,   reduce world poverty FACT and for that  reason I fully support it.


See the evolution from ruthless opportunistic trader to revolutionary technologist.  The world, like the interviewer, is not yet prepared.


Square card reader is 3.25%+$.15 to use.  $3.60 per $100.00. $103.60 to send/ $96.4 to receive $100.  3.25% is not hard for crypto to compete with.


Laughs as they disparage D&D .. but it's making a HUGE comeback too.


bitcoin to the moon


Digibyte will skyrocket the market! Digibyte has solved every flaw old cryptos had! Mark my words! Here we are, and the time is near.


There is a big difference between money and currency. Understand it and know which is a store of value, and which is not. Use your #commonsense or accept the consecuences.


Just finished this. Respect to Novogratz. The interviewer needs to be fired asap. For Gods Sake!


I have a riddle for Novogratz - (1) what's the "stability" of a Debt Based Currency when the Debt Bubble Pops? (2) What's the "stablility" of a $100 Bill on Fire?  You're a Macro guy? Seriously? Your perspective is myopic to your lifetime - you aren't as smart as you think you are. We're watching a Debt Supercycle run its course, and the "Macro" perspective needs to be a lot longer than your lifetime or mine.


If this guy has strong hands he would have made 2.0 billion USD from 2.0 milion at the moment of writing this.


From that I gathered it NOT a currency, its a technology. It is a bubble which will pop, some will crypto-currencies will crash to nothing, BUT the technology which seems to be his main focus, is here to stay and will be developed.


Feburary 20th 2021 today and bitcoin hit $57,000 and eth is $1,879


Mike mentions Gemini which is a great exchange, however there's Coinbase too,  this is the other one that has been around a very long time. They too are regulated. Coinbase info.  https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2689172-is-coinbase-regulated-


Wonder what percentage of his portfolio is cryptocurrency now!


"theres going to be a blockchain for wine"

enter, VeChain


bitcoin is like "dungeons and dragons on steroids."


There's going to be some serious altcoin fatique in the nex 10 years . MOST will die and the value comes BACK to bitcoin .


Even This guy is underestimating who all is getting involved with crypto. I’m from Graham and Doddsville.


this guy bought $2m of ethereum @$1 each - it just crossed $600 each - casual $1.2b profit


AWesome! welcome to my world Beeotches!!


yes! needs more views!


13:20 "...it's not a money thing..." -- but the billions must help?


"Decentralized world" Dare I say....decentraland.


Everyone should be watching this video now that its 2021.


The market is young,  that's why so much volatility.   People are coming in.  I am in all the way for the long run.


Bloomberg guy is like our parents


If you want to understand what is going on here better. Begin with the blockchain. It basically makes use of two fields, with decades of research: asymmetric cryptography  & distributed ledger systems. Its power comes in the problems it solves and the opportunities it creates. For the hundreds of millions of people globally who are locked out banking at Chase. For anyone with any records to keep or making business transactions doing away with the need for trust third parties. Anyone living in a country where the gov't is running the money into the ground. etc etc etc. This is going to change so many things in so many ways. It's just going to take, like he says, 10 years or whatever. Spend some time checking out some of these projects,, theyre all over the place. what a time. ;)!!


I want life to be tokenized


"[...] all the smug arrogance that comes along with this world [...]" - lmao


he is right. you can't keep even a 100k under kitchen sink..maybe thats where the banks will step in


Very smart personality


And now 28/11almost 10.000 dollars! Insane


At 16:53 they start talking about Dungeons and Dragons. Literally.


Implementation!!!


i love tis guy!


and the price went sky high from there....


so wallstreet wants to enter the cryptospace? then i shoud HODL more and make them pay for it 100X, i suggest the same to all cryptohodlers out there


I like this dude


ETN to the Moon! :)


Great Interview! Subbed. I am researching this topic to prepare for the trading of bitcoin on CME. Will make videos about this in the future.


Far more "smug arrogance" in this interviewer and in traditional finance than in crypto.


its just a previously super rich guy, who got on the bitcoin train, and became even more rich... um... wouldnt we all be if we had 2 million to throw around here and there


If Bitcoin pops at some point will litecoin and Ethereum and other altcoins most likely shoot up off of it?


These folks arent anything special they just had large amounts of money to invest at the start. meanwhile us peasants maybe not of made millions but we made thousands.


wait... floyd mayweather knows how to use a computer? he bought bitcoin? when did he learn how to read?


Ether is $736 12/13/17


Gotta love that pesky fly. LOL


2:49 there a fly flying around. I can't unsee and now you also can't.


Who the hell does Eric Schatzker think he is, laughing at the “smug arrogance” of the crypto community at 15:20, and then to absolutely epitomizing the smug arrogance of Wall Street at 16:55-17:08?  Look at that smirk when he says "dungeons and dragons on steroids!"  We'll see who has the last laugh, Mr. Tom Ford Suit...


"not in jesuscoin" lmao


If something is booming all these guys come out of the woodworks....


100 usd for 5 months will make the average person rich


When he says Shit, the reporter almost falls off his chair with nervousness.


I am here in 2021. A stop in my rabbit hole.


love his swearing lol


EOS = Ethereum On Steroids


Dumb question. Can the block chain be invested in?


If you own BTC on coinbase before the fork, how would you obtain your bitcoin cash if coinbase doesnt support bitcoin cash?


Legendary


that fly :D


GO.... BITCOIN .... GO .


OUR GUY


he convinced a lot o people to buy cripto with this video. How many did lose money, because they thought this guy says good things?


The bloomberg guy is clueless. He won't understand until it's too late.


I really got reengaged. I realized I could make a FAK ton of money.


Right now it appears that the Big crytpo "whales" the owners of the most cryptos are using the following schemes to make the price volatile: 1 Pump and Dump 2: Market Makers posting Hype news 3: Complex and fast trading Algorithms buying cryto then selling quickly within minutes to seconds to capture quick profits 4: WASH TRADING 5: SPOOFING....... the small crypto investor has little chance - good luck.


That damn fly in the video! Dude needs a shower! LOL!


AGAIN if you do NOT understand crypto currency then PLEASE do NOT invest in it . Perhaps read my comments to learn more.


Bitcoin slow and high fees. Outdated technology


Does he still fly helicopters ?


Funny no one mentioned there's a fly near his head at 2:51


buy bitcoin!


does anyone else notice that damned fly hovering around mike's mouth?


Bitcoin is inferior to Litecoin. It's "1st to market" advantage is going to start to get eaten away sometimes soon.
You can hear people saying it, "Ya, it's not very functional, but it's a store of value". Really, a store of value in something that isn't very functional. That's not going to last long.


that fly tho


WTC to the moon!


So what should a person do right now to get in?
